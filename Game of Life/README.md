# Game of Life

## Introduction
The [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton where every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## How to Play
To play the Game of Life, use the following commands on the PS/2 keyboard:

- **w** : Move up
- **s** : Move down
- **a** : Move left
- **d** : Move right
- **n** : Advance to the next state
